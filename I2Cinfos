I2C - Inter Integrated Circuit
I2C pins in BCM mode are: 2, 3
I2C pins in WiringPi are: 8, 9
The Raspberry Pi's I2C pins are an extremely useful way to talk to many different types of external peripheral; from the MCP23017 digital IO expander, to a connected ATmega.

The I2C pins include a fixed 1.8 kohms pull-up resistor to 3.3v. This means they are not suitable for use as general purpose IO where a pull-up is not required.

You can verify the address of connected I2C peripherals with a simple one-liner:

sudo apt-get install i2c-tools
sudo i2cdetect -y 1
You can then access I2C from Python using the smbus library:

import smbus
DEVICE_BUS = 1
DEVICE_ADDR = 0x15
bus = smbus.SMBus(DEVICE_BUS)
bus.write_byte_data(DEVICE_ADDR, 0x00, 0x01)

At the command prompt type one of these depending on whether you are using the I2C0 or I2C1 port:


sudo i2cdetect -y 0

BCM 2 (I2C Data)
Alt0	Alt1	Alt2	Alt3	Alt4	Alt5
I2C1 SDA	SMI SA3	DPI VSYNC	AVEOUT VSYNC	AVEIN VSYNC	
Physical pin 3
BCM pin 2
Wiring Pi pin 8
BCM pin 0 on Rev 1 ( very early ) Pi
SDA (i2c Data) is one of the i2c pins on the Pi, learn more about i2c.

SDA includes a fixed, 1.8 kohms pull-up to 3.3v, which means this pin is not suitable for use as a general purpose IO where no pullup resistor is desired.


BCM 3 (I2C Clock)
Alt0	Alt1	Alt2	Alt3	Alt4	Alt5
I2C1 SCL	SMI SA2	DPI HSYNC	AVEOUT HSYNC	AVEIN HSYNC	
Physical pin 5
BCM pin 3
Wiring Pi pin 9
BCM pin 1 on Rev 1 ( very early ) Pi
SCL (i2c Clock) is one of the i2c pins on the Pi, learn more about i2c.

SCL includes a fixed, 1.8 kohms pull-up to 3.3v, which means this pin is not suitable for use as a general purpose IO where no pullup resistor is desired.


BCM 0 (HAT EEPROM i2c Data)
Alt0	Alt1	Alt2	Alt3	Alt4	Alt5
I2C0 SDA	SMI SA5	DPI CLK	AVEOUT VCLK	AVEIN VCLK	
Physical pin 27
BCM pin 0
Wiring Pi pin 30
These pins are generally reserved for i2c communication with an EEPROM.

Connect those pins for auto configuration, if the board provides the feature (check the board description for details of EEPROM functionality).


BCM 1 (HAT EEPROM i2c Clock)
Alt0	Alt1	Alt2	Alt3	Alt4	Alt5
I2C0 SCL	SMI SA4	DPI DEN	AVEOUT DSYNC	AVEIN DSYNC	
Physical pin 28
BCM pin 1
Wiring Pi pin 31
These pins are generally reserved for i2c communication with an EEPROM.

Connect those pins for auto configuration, if the board provides the feature (check the board description for details of EEPROM functionality).

Check pinout here. http://pinout.xyz/pinout/sense_hat

Detach SenseHat from raspberry and connect through breadboard, you will have to connect these pins.

Pin 1 : 3v3 power to power sense hat.

Pin 9 (or any ground pin): Any one ground to complete circuit.

Pin 27 : ID_SD to detect sense hat
Pin 28 : ID_SC to detect sense hat.
Pin 3 (BCM2) and 5 (BCM3): which is the primary GPIO pin used by sensehat.
