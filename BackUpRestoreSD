SD card image
It may be sensible for you to keep a copy of the entire SD card image, so you can restore the card if you lose it or it becomes corrupt. 
You can do this using the same method you'd use to write an image to a new card, but in reverse.

In Linux:

sudo dd bs=4M if=/dev/sda | gzip > jessie.img.gz

To restore, pipe the output of gunzip to dd:
gunzip --stdout jessie.img.gz | sudo dd bs=4M of=/dev/sda


Note:
Where sdb is the name of your usb stick. To check/find out 
what the name is, type this in Linux.

df -h

If it's not obvious, i.e. you don't see something like /dev/sda1
Then unplug the usb stick, type it again and see what's missing.

- sda1 - The 1 is dropped as this denotes a partition number.
