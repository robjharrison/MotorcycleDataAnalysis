# Motorcycle Blackbox Data Analysis
### Incident prediction via motion data analysis.

Collection and analysis of collated video and IMU data using similar data features to many proprietary commercial automotive blackboxes (EDR). Car and larger vehicle data is significantly easier to monitor and currently gathered in increasingly larger quantities now that legislation in the US/EU dictates that key data features must be stored by the vehicle. Recorded data is rarely freely available; despite ownership being with the vehicle owner/leasee only a limited data feature set will ever be released to the owner. 

Motorcycle EDR fitment, and resultant data recording is in it's infancy, with only some manufacturers OEM fitting EDR devices (Kawasaki being one early adopter). **My own intentions aside, this repository's intention is twofold:**

    1. To create a replicable package of monitoring tools for those who wish to do their own monitoring
    2. Provide a resource for data scientists looking for data to use in a currently very very sparce data topic
